# A Brief Study on RFIDs and their Applications.

### Introduction

#### **RFID**

Radio Frequency Identification is a technology which utilizes radio frequencies to transfer data.
The setup for an RFID consists of a sensor and a card/tag with rfid capabilities.

#### **RFID Cards**

RFID cards & tags have 3 main components, an Antenna, a Chip, and the substrate(the pvc card).

The chip holds all the data, and the antenna transfers and recieves signals. The antenna is a copper(or any other material) coil in a tag, or etched on the surface, in case of a card.

#### **Available Technologies**

There exist 3 types of RFID Cards: 

1. LF (low frequency) => Range {30KHz - 300KHz}
2. HF (high frequency) => Range {3 - 30MHz}
1. UHF (ultra high frequency) => Range {300MHz - 3GHz}

Cards either have an EEPROM or they are laser engraved during manufacturing.

EEPROM cards are also known as CUID(changeable UID) cards since they are modifiable electronically.

Laser Engraved cards are known as UUID(unique uid).
