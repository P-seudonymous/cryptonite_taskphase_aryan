Hint: NONE

This chal was a little painful since i had to brute 18 cookie requests.

could have written a script in python but i dont have enough knowledge as to give requests to websites.
used cookie-manager, a browser extension to brute the requests.

funnily, i found a site, https://www.allrecipes.com/gallery/most-popular-types-of-cookies/ , which had all the cookies in order, ie macaron is 19 in this list and in the chal, and this is true for almost all the cookies.

this was the final flag.
