## lvl 1

```cat readme``` gave me the password.

## lvl 2

running ```cat -``` did not work as it acted as a command which redirected me to new line.
therefore, i cd'd into ```/``` and ran ```cat /home/bandit1/-``` and it gave me the password.

## lvl 3

since the filename had spaces, i ran ```cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename``` and it gave me the password.

## lvl 4

in this lvl, the file was hidden in the directory ```/inhere```. running ```ls -a``` showed me the file, and then catting it gave me the password.

## lvl 5

i couldn't find any optimal solution for this problem, so i opened 7 files manually until i found the password. -file07 contained the password.

## lvl 6
